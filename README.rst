NAPS
====

Here we present NAPS (NAPS is ArUco Plus SLEAP), a hybrid behavioral tracking technique combining state-of-the-art deep learning-based tracking methods and fiducial tags for identity persistence while reducing overhead, such as cost and setup time, for high-throughput tracking.


NAPS documentation can be found at `naps.readthedocs.io <https://naps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
