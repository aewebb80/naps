NAPS
====


NAPS (NAPS is ArUco Plus SLEAP), is a tool for researchers with two goals: (1) to quantify animal behavior over a long timescale and high resolution, with minimal human bias, and (2) to track the behavior of individuals with a high level of identity-persistence.  This could be of use to researchers studying social network analysis, animal communication, task specialization, or gene-by-environment interactions.  By combining deep-learning based pose estimation software with easily read and minimally invasive fiducial markers ("tags"), we provide an easy-to-use solution for producing high-quality, high-dimensional behavioral data.  

NAPS documentation can be found at `naps.readthedocs.io <https://naps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
